    <h3>Thrissur, formerly Trichur, city, central Kerala state, southwestern India. The city is located 12 miles (19 km) inland from the Arabian Sea coast on an extensive lagoon system.

        Thrissur, a commercial and cultural centre, is considered to be the oldest city on the west coast of India. Its name means “small sacred place.” The city is built around a hillock topped by the Vadakkumnathan Temple (dedicated to Shiva), the focus of an annual festival. A city of many faiths, Thrissur is also home to some of the oldest mosques and churches in the country. Its industries include cotton weaving, rice and oilseed milling, soap manufacturing, and sawmilling. </h3>
